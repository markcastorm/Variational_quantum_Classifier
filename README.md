# Variational Quantum Classifier

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) using Qiskit. 

## Overview

A VQC is a type of machine learning algorithm that utilizes a quantum computer for classification tasks. It leverages a quantum circuit (ansatz) to encode input data into a quantum state. This encoded state is then evolved using a set of parameters called variational parameters, which are optimized to minimize the difference between the output state and the target state. After optimization, the output is measured, and the results are used to make predictions on the input data.

## Notebook Contents

This notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Variational Ansatz:** Explores different types of ansatz circuits, including EfficientSU2 and RealAmplitudes, for encoding classical data into quantum states.
2. **Classification:** Demonstrates the classification process using ZFeatureMap and RealAmplitudes, including data binding, circuit execution, and result interpretation.
3. **Parity Function:** Introduces a parity function used to label data based on the number of 1's in a bitstring.
4. **Sampling-based and Expectation-based Results:** Shows how to obtain classification results using both sampling and expectation-based methods.
5. **2-Feature Example:** Provides a practical example with 2 features, using a circle dataset for visualization and classification.
6. **Qiskit Implementation:** Demonstrates the implementation of the VQC using Qiskit, including circuit construction, optimization, and prediction.
7. **Qiskit Quantum Machine Learning:** Introduces the VQC class from Qiskit Machine Learning for simplified VQC implementation.
